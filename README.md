This powerful reporting library aims to simplify producing reports using iText. The most demanding and coding intensive tasks when producing reports with iText are:
- how to get from data to report elements
- how to style those blocks
- how to evaluate (debug) the resulting report layout.

Exactly those three tasks are simplified by this library:

- xml configuration and/or annotations to transform existing Java data objects into report blocks
- provide styling information (css like, syntax independent) seperate from code
- a firebug like debug mode to help evaluate your report.
