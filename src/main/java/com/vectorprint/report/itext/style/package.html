      <div>interfaces and classes to support configurable styling of iText reporting elements in a css like manner.
         Normally you will not need to develop your own classes, the default implementations are provided in BaseReportGenerator and will probably do just fine. What you probably do need to do is load fonts using the FontLoader.</div>
